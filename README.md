# JustBuy – Simple E-Commerce Website

JustBuy is a small e-commerce website I built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.  
This project was mainly created for learning and practice. I wanted to understand how a multi-page website works, how to handle a cart system on the front-end, and how to make everything responsive for mobile users.

The website has four main pages: Home, Products, Contact, and Cart. The layout is clean and simple, and the navigation works well on both desktop and mobile screens. Most of the UI is styled with Bootstrap, along with a few custom CSS adjustments.

The cart feature is handled through JavaScript and localStorage. When a user adds an item to the cart, the data is saved locally, so even if the page reloads, the items remain. The cart page also lets users remove items and automatically updates the total price.

This project does not use any backend or database. Everything is handled on the client side. It’s a good starting point for anyone who wants to understand the basics of building an e-commerce layout or wants a small front-end project for their portfolio.
